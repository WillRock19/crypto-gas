## Introduction

## What is this project about?

## Our technologies

### Client-side

We use ReactJs created with [Vite Js](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) tooling instead of webpack. The idea here is first of all test vite js, since using it is probably an overkill for the objectives of this project.

### Smart contract

We use [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) programming language.
